## Overview

Our project aims to address the limitations of existing systems by designing and developing a **web-based Student Management System (SMS)** specifically tailored for tuition centers. The system offers a variety of modules to enhance the efficiency of administrative and academic processes. These modules include:

- **Student-Teacher Profile Management**  
- **Fee Management**  
- **Student Assessment Feedback**  
- **Attendance Records**  
- **Alerts and Notifications**  
- **Timetable Management**

The SMS streamlines processes, improves communication, and enhances data security. This leads to more time for core educational activities, better-informed decision-making, and ultimately, a more supportive learning environment for students.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Since this is a private project, please refer to the video tutorial on how to clone it using SSH:

- [How to Clone a Private Repository](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvvIuqj4YTY)

### 2. Install Composer Dependencies

- First, check if Composer is installed by running:
  ```bash
  composer
  ```
  If Composer is not installed, follow the [installation guide](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).

- In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and Laravel folder, then run:
  ```bash
  composer global require laravel/installer
  composer install
  php artisan serve
  ```

  **Note**: If you encounter any issues with Composer not being found, run the following:
  ```bash
  composer global require laravel/installer
  composer install
  ```

For more information on setting up Laravel, visit the [Laravel Installation Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/installation).

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (React)

- Install Node.js and NPM if you haven't already.
- Navigate to the `react` folder inside the project directory and run:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  For React setup instructions, refer to this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiD2aoL7zHs&t=486s).

### 4. Database Setup

- Duplicate `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
- Run the following command to generate the application key:
  ```bash
  php artisan key:generate
  ```

- Create an empty database in your local database management tool (e.g., phpMyAdmin).

- Update the `.env` file with the database settings:
  ```env
  DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
  DB_DATABASE=C:\xampp\htdocs\student-management-system\database\database.sqlite
  ```

- Run the database migrations to set up the tables:
  ```bash
  php artisan migrate
  ```

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running:

1. **Access the application**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the Student Management System.
